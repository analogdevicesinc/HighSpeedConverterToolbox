# Behavioral Models


The toolbox contains behavioral simulation models of different data converters that can be used in MATLAB and Simulink. These are designed to help users understand device limitations and advanced feature sets. As well as to test their algorithms and signal processing against.
The currently supported behavioral models are:

- [AD9081 MxFE Quad, 16-Bit, 12GSPS RFDAC and Quad, 12-Bit, 4GSPS RFADC](models/ad9081/top_level.tex.md)
